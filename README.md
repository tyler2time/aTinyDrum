# aTinyDrum
A dual attiny85 powered eurorack drum module.

This is my first go at a public Github repository. I will use the first repository for my next project which is a going to be a sample player for a couple drum sounds.
I have chosen this as my next module purely for the fact that I have tons of sources for drumlines (O_c, Europi, Beatstep, Euclidian modules etc.) but I have no modules dedicated for the drum sounds.  I can use Plaits for 1 drum part but then you loose all the other beautiful sounds Plaits produces. I can easily create kick, snare, clap and hat sounds through patching but then 3/4s of modules are then dedicated to a 3 instrument drum line.

There a plenty of makers that have wonderful dedicated drum sound modules for fairly cheap but I want to go the DIY route and see how much I can pull out of these attiny85 chips.  I am sure I will be pulling most of the code from others hard work and I hope when I do, I give credit where it is deserved.
